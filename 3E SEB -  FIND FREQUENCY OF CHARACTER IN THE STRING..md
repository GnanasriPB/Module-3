## SEB - FIND FREQUENCY OF CHARACTER IN THE STRING.

---

### AIM  
 To Write a python program to find the frequency of the given character in the string.
---

ALGORITHM

1.Begin the program.

2.Input the string from the user (or define a string directly).

3.Input the character whose frequency is to be found.

4.Initialize a counter to 0.

5.Loop through each character in the string:

If the current character matches the given character:

Increment the counter by 1.

6.Print the frequency (value of the counter).

7.Terminate the program.


 PROGRAM

a=input()

b=input()

c=0

for i in a:

    if i in b:
    
        c=c+1
        
print(f"Character {b} in the {a} is {c} times")
