## TUPLES - TO CREATE TUPLE WITH REPETITION.



AIM 

To Create a python code to create tuple with repetition for N times.


ALGORITHM

1.Begin the program.

2.Input the original tuple from the user or define it manually.

3.Input the number of times (N) the tuple should be repeated.

4.Multiply the tuple by N using the * operator to repeat its elements.

5.Print the resulting repeated tuple.

6.Terminate the program.


 PROGRAM
 
t = eval(input())  

n = int(input())

result = t * n

print(result)
